Implications by their presence in aquatic and soil ecosystems have been well studied and documented, but less attention has been paid on airborne microplastics (MPs). Studies concerning airborne microplastics started from 2016 and only a few (n = 13) have been published to date. Although, studies may increase in the following years, since air is very important for human survival. Microplastics have been observed in atmospheric fallouts in indoor and outdoor environments using a sampling or vacuum pump, rain sampler, and/or particulate fallout collector. Identification and quantification have been carried out by visual, spectroscopic, and spectrometric techniques. Factors such as meteorological, climatic, and anthropogenic influence the distribution and …"

In this study, we presented an overview of information based on literature concerning exposure to MPs and the toxicity of such exposure. Currently, four major routes of exposure have been identified including entanglement, contact, ingestion and inhalation. Humans maybe the most exposed organism because they are at the peak of the food chain. Toxicology effect to marine and freshwater organisms are classified based on exposure dosage as either high (mortality, decreased reproductive output, organ damage) or low (changes in behavior with time). On plants, reports have shown that MPs exposure can affect negatively the growth and depending on exposure concentration and types of MPs and oxidative activities. However, effects on plants maybe short-term and transient. Although, toxicity …"
"CE Enyoh, AW Verla, NJ Egejuru",2018,J Environ Anal Chem,5,2,1-9,"Inhabitants of Orji are still pending on borehole water for drinking water without any treatment. The storage of this water in household containers for a long time as well as the handling might lead to a quality deteriorated and become unsuitable for human consumption. The study therefore evaluated the effect of long storage on pH values as well as determined the total concentrations of Ni, Cd, Cu, Pb and Fe in 10 borehole water samples from Orji. The pH was determined using Jenway 3510 pH meter while Perkins Elmer Analyst Atomic Absorption Spectrophometer was used for heavy metals determination after acid digestion. The results obtained were compared to National Agency for Food Drugs and Control (NAFDAC) and Standard Organization of Nigeria (SON) standard and were chemometrically assessed. The mean concentrations of the studied metals were below standard. pH continually increased with storage but did not exceed the standard range of (6.3/6.5-8.5) set by SON/NAFDAC over 12 weeks. Chemometric assessment such as linear regression analysis revealed positive association between pH values and metal concentration. The association were in the order of significant pH/Fe (0.202)> pH/Cd (0.169)> pH/Ni (0.161)> pH/Pb (0.123) respectively. Spearman’s correlation revealed similar source (s) of contamination of the studied metals except for Fe. Coefficient of Variation (CV) showed low variability (< 20). Contamination Factor (CF) showed low contamination (< 1), except for Cadmium which showed moderate to considerable contamination. Pollution Load Index (PLI) showed no pollution (< 1) while mean WQI revealed “poor …"

Information on the accumulation of MPs in aquatic species has been well documented, while information on the uptake and accumulation of MPs by higher plants is still very scarce. Terrestrial edible plants are directly exposed to MPs when soil was applied with sludge, organic fertilizer, plastic mulching, waste water irrigation, plastic littering, surface runoff or from atmospheric deposition of airborne MP. One study using fluorescent marker recently showed that plant can accumulate MP through uptake from MP polluted soil. Thus, potentially contaminating the base of the food-web and also indicating new exposure route to MP ingestion. This review present a discuss of the implication of these findings to human, who may be ingesting an estimated 80 g of MP through eating of plant daily as global consumption rate of plant continually increase. Also, benefit for the terrestrial ecosystem is discussed, by which plant acts as a potential remediator of MP polluted soil either by phytoextraction, phytostabilization and phytofilteration. We conclude by pointing knowledge gap and suggesting key future areas of research for scientists and policymakers."

"VA Wirnkor, EC Ebere, VE Ngozi",2019,Anal. Methods Environ. Chem. J,2,13-30,"Microplastics are ubiquitous tiny plastic particles (< 5 mm) nonbiodegradable and have large surface area in the environment or the body of living things due to anthropogenic activities or fragmentation of plastic debris. Though they have been found in sea food and human body, their health implications are still speculative. Moreover, a major reason for dearth of information on this topical issue is the lack of standard operating protocol for detecting and quantifying microplastics as a result of their presence in more complex environmental matrices. In the present review some methodologies for analyzing microplastics reported in the period 2000 to 2018 have been documented with the aim of assessing which methods is most suitable and in what matrix. The following methods have been studied: CHN analyzers, pyrolysisgas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (PyrGC/MS), optical microscopy, fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (Micro-FTIR), raman microspectroscopy (RMS) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), effective for particles< 500 μm. However, the quality of result obtained strongly relies on good sampling and sample purification. Specifically, Micro-Raman spectroscopy is best for particles of< 1 μm while degradation process of plastics is best monitored with SEM-EDS. Generally, studies have been conducted with often a combination of two methods: one separating and the other quantifying which can be problematic moreso in living tissue where there is no harm reported as at the time of this study. Ultimately based on this study, microplastics have become a cause for concern …","Zitiert von: 51

The soil samples were collected from the top soil and the palm oil were collected immediately after extraction. Palm oil and soil were analyzed using standard analytical methods and the results obtained were compared to standards. The physicochemical analysis of the soil samples showed that ranges of EC (323.33±0.57-480.33±1.53 us/cm); Moisture Content (MC) ranged from 20.9±0.80 to 40.8±0.10);% SOM (1.92±0.61-4.85±0.01) which were within the acceptable limits while CEC, iron content and lead were not significant. Palm oil samples had MC (0.32±0.09%) which was above the acceptable limit. The oil was acidic and free fatty acid (FFA) result for 10days showed even much acidic ranges from (2.15±0.01 to 6.07±0.05 mgNaOH/g) with Fe,(2.00±0.01 to 5.43±0.51 mgNaOH/g) with Pb and (1.27±0.03 to 5.04±0.03 mgNaOH/g) without contamination. This was tested using anova at p< 0.05 respectively and there was a significant difference between the results. However, the result obtained from these areas shows good quality soil for palm tree cultivation.","Zitiert von: 50

This has witnessed growing number of models for assessment purposes. Some of these provide useful information, and reduce large data for easier understanding by policy-makers. In the current study of pollution, we used data from four locations: Oil Market, Trans Amadi, Borrokiri and GRA in Port Harcourt and a control taken from Federal Land Resource Umuahia (FLRU). A total of 25 composite soil samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters and heavy metals, by means of a 969 Unicam AAS model series. The data obtained were then subjected to index models. Results showed iron (Fe) to be most abundant metal, ranging from 10.44 to 19.54 mg/kg, then Ni (8.03 to 13.6mg/kg), Cd (3.96 to 5.41 mg/kg), Pb (1.36 to 7.64 mg/kg), Zn (0.09 to 7.24 mg/kg), Cu (0.16 to 0.32) and As (0.07 to 0.11 mg/kg). All metal concentrations were below permissible limits set by NESRA. Contamination factor (Cf) and Igeo revealed moderate to heavy contamination by Cd and Zn. Anthropogenicity revealed that increasing metals in the environment are largely from anthropogenic inputs. The Pollution Index revealed that soils were unpolluted (PLI < 1) with the heavy metals. Furthermore, the Sodium absorption ratio showed that the soils are less sodic and could be good soils for plant growth. All four sites showed a linear relationship between anthropogenicity and geoaccumulation indexes, and so both indexes furnish basically the same information However, pollution from these metals in the study area should be under routine check for …"

In this study, we presented index models that can be address this issue. Index models for pollution and health risks assessment was applied to MP data obtained from rivers in Nwangele L.G.A. Models such as microplastics contamination factor (MPCF), microplastics pollution load index (MPPLI), Microplastics polymer risk indices (Hi) and pollution risk index (MPR) for pollution and contamination assessment. Health risk models such estimated daily intake (EDI) and microplastic carcinogenic risks (MPCR) through oral and dermal pathway were also presented and applied. Results showed that there is no direct correlation of MP abundance with MPR. However, Hi correlated but with MPR. Increased MPs pollution risks and levels were extensively subject to the presence of harmful MPs polymers, just as the high MPs pollution loads index (MPPLI). The index models enabled easy comparison of MP pollution of the different rivers and provided concise information on the status of MPs in the rivers."

Despite this unique property, anthropogenic activities along its course and natural factors often determine the composition of water. In the current research, the portion of River Nworie having past Owerri town was sampled in the dry season 2017 to determine its ionic composition at predestinated points and to relate such properties to its physicochemical characteristics. Studies relating physicochemical properties and dissolved toxic ions in water could develop a body of knowledge that could enable detection and quantification of potential risk of ions such as heavy metals from natural water to aquatic ecosystem, animal and human health without actually involving aquatic organism, animal and human. Clean sterile plastic bottles were used for collecting surface water. A total of 30 sub-samples from five points at 300 m apart were sampled in the morning. Physicochemical properties were determined using standard methods and ionic composition of water was determined according methods of APHA. Results revealed that Ca2+ had a mean 23.60 ± 0.67 mg/l and was the highest while K+ with a mean 0.72 ± 0.30 was the least amongst major cations.

Finally, from such studies, data generated will provide insight and understanding into the extent of microplastic pollution in Nigeria. Furthermore, the data will be important not only for both remediation and minimization of effects but could be employed in averting occurrence through policies such as ban on some types of plastic uses in Nigeria.
